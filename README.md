### Hi, I'm Sen Li. 

### I have a background in Ecology and a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. I mainly worked on the speciation and evolution of mangroves during my Ph.D. and now I'm working on the CNV of breast cancer genomes. 

### For me, different species and cells have their unique ways of coping with changes in the macro- and micro-environment. I am interested in using bioinformatics tools to unravel the stories of different research subjects.

### I use GitHub to store some homemade pipelines and welcome to discuss them with me.
